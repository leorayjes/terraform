# Multi-Environment Deployment Challenge

A Terraform hackathon challenge focused on building intelligent, environment-aware infrastructure that scales from simple development setups to full production deployments.

## Challenge Overview

Teams must build a single Terraform codebase that dynamically deploys different infrastructure configurations based on environment variables. The infrastructure should automatically adapt its complexity and resources based on the target environment.

## Environment Tiers

### Development Environment
- **Goal**: Minimal, cost-effective setup for developers
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Single EC2 instance (t3.micro)
  - Basic security group (SSH + HTTP)
  - Simple S3 bucket for storage
  - No load balancer or scaling

### Staging Environment  
- **Goal**: Medium complexity for testing and validation
- **Infrastructure**:
  - 2 EC2 instances (t3.small) with basic load balancing
  - Application Load Balancer
  - RDS database (t3.micro)
  - Enhanced security groups
  - VPC with public/private subnets

### Production Environment
- **Goal**: Full production setup with monitoring, backup, and auto-scaling
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Auto Scaling Group (3-10 instances, t3.medium)
  - Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
  - Multi-AZ RDS with automated backups
  - ElastiCache for caching
  - CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
  - S3 with versioning and lifecycle policies
  - IAM roles with least privilege access
  - VPC with multiple availability zones

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Terraform Workspaces**: Use workspaces to manage environment state
- **Conditional Logic**: Leverage `count`, `for_each`, and conditional expressions
- **Variable Management**: Environment-specific variable files and validation
- **Remote State**: S3 backend with state locking via DynamoDB

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: Resources should scale based on environment
2. **Conditional Resource Creation**: Some resources only exist in certain environments
3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Different instance types, storage, networking
4. **Security Gradation**: Security measures that increase with environment criticality
5. **Cost Optimization**: Development should be minimal cost, production should be optimized for performance

```

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Create Workspaces**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   terraform workspace new staging  
   terraform workspace new prod
   ```

3. **Deploy to Development**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace select dev
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

4. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace select staging
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars"
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars"
   ```

5. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace select prod
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars"
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars"
   ```
