# Security Hardening Competition

## Overview
Welcome to the Security Hardening Competition! This repository contains intentionally insecure Terraform configurations full of security anti-patterns and vulnerabilities. Your mission is to identify, analyze, and fix these security issues while implementing best practices.

## Competition Format
Teams race against the clock to:
- 🔍 **Identify** security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns
- 🛠️ **Fix** insecure configurations 
- 🔒 **Implement** security best practices
- 📋 **Document** findings and remediation steps

## Common Security Issues to Look For

### 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens in plain text
- **Overly Permissive IAM**: Policies with `*` permissions or unnecessary access
- **Public Resources**: S3 buckets, databases, or instances exposed to the internet
- **Unencrypted Storage**: Missing encryption at rest and in transit
- **Missing Access Controls**: No MFA, weak authentication

### ⚠️ Security Anti-Patterns
- Default security groups allowing all traffic
- Missing logging and monitoring
- Inadequate network segmentation
- Weak password policies
- Missing backup strategies

## Scoring Criteria

### Points System
- **Critical Fix**: 10 points
- **High Severity Fix**: 7 points  
- **Medium Severity Fix**: 5 points
- **Low Severity Fix**: 3 points
- **Best Practice Implementation**: 2 points
- **Documentation Quality**: 1-3 points

### Bonus Points
- Creative security solutions (+5 points)
- Automation/scripting (+3 points)
- Comprehensive testing (+3 points)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS CLI configured (use provided credentials)
- Git for version control

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd terraform-security-hardening

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the current configuration
terraform plan
```

## Security Best Practices to Implement

### 1. Secrets Management
- [ ] Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- [ ] Implement proper key rotation
- [ ] Remove hardcoded credentials

### 2. IAM Security
- [ ] Apply principle of least privilege
- [ ] Use specific resource ARNs instead of `*`
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Enable MFA requirements

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure encryption in transit
- [ ] Implement proper key management

### 4. Network Security
- [ ] Implement proper VPC configuration
- [ ] Use security groups with minimal required access
- [ ] Configure NACLs appropriately
- [ ] Enable VPC Flow Logs

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch monitoring
- [ ] Set up security alerts
- [ ] Implement log analysis

## Advanced Challenges

### Terraform Best Practices
- Use variables and data sources effectively
- Implement conditional logic for different environments
- Create reusable modules
- Add proper resource tagging
- Implement state file security

### Infrastructure as Code Security
- Static analysis with tools like `tfsec` or `checkov`
- Implement CI/CD pipeline security
- Use Terraform validation rules
- Document security decisions

## Submission Guidelines

### Required Deliverables
1. **Fixed Terraform configurations** with security improvements
2. **Security assessment report** documenting:
   - Vulnerabilities found
   - Remediation steps taken
   - Risk assessment (before/after)
3. **Implementation guide** for best practices added

### Documentation Format
Create a `SECURITY_FIXES.md` file with:
```markdown
## Vulnerability: [Name]
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Location**: file:line_number
- **Issue**: Description of the problem
- **Fix**: What was changed
- **Impact**: Risk reduction achieved
```

## Tools and Resources

### Security Scanning Tools
- `tfsec` - Terraform static analysis
- `checkov` - Infrastructure as code security scanner
- `terraform validate` - Built-in validation
- AWS Config - Compliance monitoring

### Useful AWS Security Services

- AWS GuardDuty  
- AWS Inspector
- AWS Trusted Advisor

## Competition Rules

### Time Limit
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Check-in**: Every 30 minutes for progress updates
- **Final submission**: 15 minutes before deadline

### Team Guidelines
- Maximum 4 members per team
- All changes must be committed to git
- Document your approach and reasoning
- No external assistance beyond provided resources

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Security Impact** (40%) - Severity of issues fixed
2. **Best Practices** (30%) - Implementation quality
3. **Documentation** (20%) - Clear explanations and processes  
4. **Innovation** (10%) - Creative solutions and automation
